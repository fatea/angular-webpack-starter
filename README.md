# babel-webpack-gulp-starter (take Angular as an example)


A modified version of combination of angular-seed and yeoman-angular. It provides users with boost of an angular project, which enables **webpack to wrap everything** into a **bundle.js** and enables **babel to help you write JS in ES6 and ES7**, for instance, array functions, decorators and async/await keywords.

## Attention
This readme file will be updated soon because this repo is no longer a simple modification of angular-seed.

## TODO:
Use gulp to automatically manage the project.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the this repository and install the dependencies using `npm install` && `bower install`.
